KKB Epay Drupal module
======================

A Drupal 7 module that adds support for Epay payments system.

This module is created for e-commerce websites that operate primarily in
Kazakhstan. It gives site owners an option to accept credit card payments
and process them at http://epay.kkb.kz, the largest processing center in
the country.

The module is integrated with Ubercart (stable) and Commerce (work in
progress). Integration with Payment and a number of other modules is planned.
On top of that, 3rd-party developers can use complete API of this module and
add Epay support into their custom e-commerce solutions (extensive
documentation and usage examples are included).
